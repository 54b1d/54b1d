### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a graduate in marketing and an Android app developer. I adore developing applications that help people, especially in business and e-commerce. To maintain my projects, collaborate with other developers, and display my work, I use Github.

I'm constantly searching for fresh challenges and chances to advance as a marketer and developer.
